Current release version:  0.2.0-prerelease

The process for publishing a release to GitHub and the app stores is as follows:

* Check out the most recent version of develop.
* Open the Sensus solution.
* Determine the new Sensus release version based on the version at the top of this file and the Semantic Versioning guidelines (http://semver.org). Below, we'll refer to this new version as [RELVERSION].
* Update the release version at the top of this file to be [RELVERSION].

===== Begin Platform-Specific Steps =====

Android
* Right-click on the Sensus.Android project, go to Android Manifest, and increment "Version number" by 1.
* Also under Android Manifest, update "Version name" to be [RELVERSION].
* In Sensus.Android, Properties, AssemblyInfo.cs, update the "Assembly Version" and "Assembly File Version" to be [RELVERSION]. Note that .NET requires version identifiers in a.b.c.d format, but [RELVERSION] follows Semantic Versioning guidelines (a.b.c-xxxx). To get around this, use a.b.c.0 in AssemblyInfo.cs.
* Build the Android.Sensus project, run tests, resolve any errors, and test Sensus by deploying to a physical device (not an emulator).

===== End Platform-Specific Steps =====

* Close Visual Studio.
* Commit all changes to develop and push develop to GitHub.
* Merge develop into master.
* Push master to GitHub.
* On GitHub, draft a new release based on the commit you just made to master, with release tag "[platform]-v[RELVERSION]" and release title "[platform] Sensus release v[RELVERSION]", where [platform] is "Android", "iOS", or "WinPhone".
* Pull down the new release tag (e.g., git pull).
* Check out the new release tag (e.g., git checkout Android-v0.1.0-prerelease). Don't worry about running in "detached head" state. We're not going to make any changes.
* Open the Sensus solution in Visual Studio.

===== Begin Platform-Specific Steps =====

Android
* Switch the Solution Configuration to AppStore.
* Rebuild the Sensus.Android project.
* Select Tools -> Android -> Publish Android App...
* Sign the APK with the Sensus keystore and save it locally.
* Publish APK to Google Play.

iOS
* Under construction...

Windows Phone
* Under construction... 

===== End Platform-Specific Steps =====

* You can now delete the release tag if you wish (e.g., git tag -d Android-v0.1.0-prerelease).
